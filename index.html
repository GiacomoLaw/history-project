  <h2>Films in Weimar Germany</h2>
    <p>The Weimar republic was an explosion of culture across all of the German socio-economic landscape, particularly during the Golden Years (1925-29) thanks to people like Stresemann and Dawes for renewing the economy - the main issue for a cultural failure. 
<br /><br />
This explosion allowed filmmakers and actors to express themselves more openly and previous restrictions from The Kaiser on filmmaking no longer applied. This meant therefore that important topics were shown, displayed and explored. These included communism, anarchism, nationalism and sexual liberation as well as liberalism in general. This makes the films from this period, which is only 5 years in length, very interesting artistic takes on ideology.

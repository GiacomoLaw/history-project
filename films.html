  <h2>Styles of films in Weimar Germany</h2>
    <p>The key difference between pre-Weimar film and Weimar film was the change between an Authoritarian dictatorship and a liberal democracy. As mentioned previously, this allowed for greater criticism of both different ideas and ideologies as well as something not seen before - criticism of the ruling Government. 
<br /><br />
In the following films, different ideological ideas are explored -from left-wing Socialism to Right Wing Nationalism. In addition, animated films, such as Prince Ahmed were experimented with and explored, thus showing the newfound creativity in the German republic and the expression its people were not allowed.This is alongside showcasing the newfound sexual and societal improvements for women, as well as their power in society.

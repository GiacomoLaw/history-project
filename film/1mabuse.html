  <h2>Dr Mabuse</h2>
    <p>A 1922 film, directed by Fritz Lang, depicting an evil manipulator, hypnotist, psychologist and  gambler who oversees the criminal underworld of Berlin. 
<br /><br />
This film exaggerates the crippling poverty from the Hyperinflation in Germany and shows the poor and impoverished in sympathetic eyes. It concludes, after several hours of witnessing his evil antics, with him being confined to a insanity asylum. 
<br /><br />
Though early on the Weimar republic, it became a key film in its field as it represents poverty and the working class and its struggle. Throughout the film there is serious conflict underlined, with Dr Mabuse representing the Spartacists generally, however on a deeper level the Dr represents the evil within German society.

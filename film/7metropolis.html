  <h2>Metropolis</h2>
  <div class="center"><img src="../imgs/Metropolisposter.jpg" style="height:500px"/></div><br />
    <p>Most likely the most well known German expressionist film, created by Fritz Lang to represent Germany’s political and cultural struggles, as well as being part social allegory (being a metaphor for the concern of wider cultural and political issues) as well as part science fiction, depicting a future divided society, with 2 classes being the elite who live in luxury in the sun and workers who live underground. It was an incredibly ambitions project for the Weimar republic, and it costed around five million marks including the employment of up to 300 extras, yet was only filmed for several months over the span of 2 years as filming started in 1925, 2 years after the end of hyperinflation, so this movie was relatively new to the “golden years”.
<br /><br />
The film takes things from the bible, but most strongly inspired from skyscrapers that the writer saw when he visited New York in October 1924. He said that the glaring streets and the skyscrapers inspired him to write the film.
<br /><br />
The film is set in a future urban dystopia and it follows the attempts of the main character, Freder, who is the wealthy son of the ruler, and Maria, a poor worker, to overcome the gulf separating their classes. This was probably inspired by the recent hyperinflation crisis that occurred a few years earlier. This future setting offered a means of escaping the hardships of daily life, and sci-fi was most popular along with historical genres because of it’s disconnection but relativity with the German people’s lives.
<br /><br />
Metropolis was born out of Lang’s (as previously stated) first sight of skyscrapers in New York in October 1924 and he stated it was “the crossroads of multiple and confused human forces, blinded and knocking into one another in an irresistible desire for exploitation and living in perpetual anxiety.” he wanted the city to be quite literally built on inequality, with the city being home to exploitation, power, corruption and greed.
<br /><br />
It had its premiere in the Ufa-Palast am Zoo in Berlin (Germany's biggest city meant a big audience, something Weimar directors wanted the most out of their films) on 10 January 1927, and it was said that the film was met with lots of applause. However, other accounts said that the film was met with only a small amount of applause and some boos and hisses. Overall, it proved unpopular with filmgoers but apparently critically applauded and historically considered as a forerunner to modern sci-fi films, which is a very big market.

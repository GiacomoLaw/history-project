  <h2>The Cabinet of Dr Caligari by Robert Wiene</h2>
    <p>Created in 1920 by Robert Wiene as one of the first silent expressionist films and is considered the most important and integral part of the German Expressionist cinema, telling the story of an insane hypnotist who uses sleepwalking on his patients to commit murders and was renowned for having peculiar setups examples including structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles and a lot of illusions. The plot is of a performing mystic and his stage sidekick who is a sleepwalking man who predicts the future, but the movie also had a twist ending, with the main character who simply thought he was driven away from his family by spirits, actually being an insane asylum patient and the “evil Dr. Caligari” was actually just the asylum director, this twist ending was innovative to cinema.
<br /><br />
1920 was an unusual time to create a movie, as it was before hyperinflation, a time where foreign film industries were easing restrictions on the import of German films following World War 1, meaning it would achieve quite a sum of money, and it was also critiqued by a US critic, Roger Ebert, who stated it was arguably “the first true horror film” and was considered a classic, as it helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema, even influence American films, most importantly horror and film noir genres.
<br /><br />
The film contained a great metaphor for a subconscious need for a tyrant in German society and is an example of the obedience to authority and the disagreement of rebelling in German society and it was also named as the prediction of the rise of Hitler and the NSDAP, as Hitler was the example of that subconsciously needed tyrant for the Germans. 
<br /><br />
Bonus fact: The actor who played Dr. Caligari, Werner Krauss was also an unapologetic anti-semite and later played several stereotypical Jewish characters, being rated as cultural ambassador of Nazi Germany by Adolf Hitler.

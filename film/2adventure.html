  <h2>The Adventure of Prince Achmed</h2>
    <p>An animated film, by Lotte Reiniger, and it took 3 years to make. On completion, it was and remains one of thee most interesting and creative stories ever in animated form, and captivated audiences of the time. 
<br /><br />
The film follows Prince Achmed, son of the caliph who has to fight a magical sorcerer who wishes to marry his sister as well as travel across magical lands. He falls in love with a Witch and is sold to the Emperor of China and then has an epic fight scene with the African sorcerer at the end. 
<br /><br />
This film explores many different creative avenues - it not only showed a multitude of fien cultures to which German audiences would have been unfamiliar, such as the Islamic and far eastern world, but also introduced the ideas of female empowerment.
<br /><br />
Directed by a woman, the film shows signs of anti-arranged marriages (the marriage of Achmed's sister to Aladin, for example) as well as the witch fighting the sorcerer at the end. This therefore made it of significant interest to the audience at the time. Additionally, the cultural impact still resonates today - the character of Aladdin was popularised further and is very much relevant today (Disney film of 1992).

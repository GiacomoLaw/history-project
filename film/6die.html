  <h2>Die Nibelungen</h2>
  <div class="center"><img src="../imgs/Nibelung.jpg" style="height:300px"/></div><br />
    <p>A five hour epic of two parts created by Fritz Lang which is a courageous and hallucinatory work, every single shot alone might be an example of visual art, with extraordinary set-pieces, archetypal themes, and unrestrained ambition prove to be an inspiration for every fantasy cycle that has been on screen ever since it’s release in 1924.
<br /><br />
Part one is of Siegfried who is the film’s protagonist acquires power of invincibility after slaying a dragon (of which a 60 foot puppet was used to demonstrate, showing dedication) and bathing in its blood. An alliance through marriage between Siegfried and the royal clan of Nibelungen turns into treachery as Siegfried’s sole weakness is exploited.
<br /><br />
Part two is Siegfried’s widow travelling to an island of the Huns to wed a monster, Attila and thereby enlist his forces in an act of vengeance that adds up to a massacre. This end piece was a terrifying end to a movie, delfing the cinema into more darker areas.
<br /><br />
Lang’s image employs its own counterpoint through a systematic viral series of strange patterns and the tribal acting of the actor’s results in a film of frightening expressionist power and a summary of Lang’s artistry.

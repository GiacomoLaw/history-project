  <h2>The Last Laugh</h2>
    <p>This 1924 film epitimises the idea of a rags to riches story. By the famed filmmaker Jannings, it depicts an elderly Doorman who loses his illustrious position as doorman of an important hotel and has to settle for working in the washroom. He is mocked by his friends and colleagues, but strikes up a friendship with the watchman. He is lonely, and isolated, but when he wore the uniform he was invigorated with life. The ending however, is one where he inherits a fortune from a millionaire. He gives out money to all the hotel staff, the new doorman and a beggar, before driving off with the watchman and beggar in a carriage. 
<br /><br />
Although on paper just a rags to riches story, it has other meanings. The most important is the change that the uniform makes. This change into something organised and non-individualist shows the transformation Nazi and Communist groups had on germans, and the changes from an individual to someone about the system is a key message of the film - a warning against paramilitarism.

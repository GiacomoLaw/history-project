  <h2>Girls in Uniform</h2>
    <p>A cultural classic feature length film based on the play Yesterday and Today, the film was created by Christa Winsloe (a woman) meaning it was a step in the right direction for equality in Germany. The story is of a girl whose mother had died when she was young and her father is in the military, meaning she is enrolled at an all-girls boarding school and she is immediately exposed to the strict nature of school as her possessions are taken from her and receives her uniform. The main cast was highly female centric, once again emphasising the equality of the golden years of the weimar republic golden years. A relationship is also sparked between the main character and a teacher, also showing gender and homosexual equality, which was very advanced for the time.
<br /><br />
The film was a success throughout much of Europe, with the kisses exchanged from the main character and the female teacher being well received, even impacting Berlin lesbian clubs. The film premiered at the Capitol cinema in Berlin until 1934 and grossed 6,000,000 reusch marks, however the cast and crew only received a quarter of the normal wage and absolutely none of the 6,000,000 rm was shared amongst the workers.
<br /><br />
The movie ran until 1934, and this meant it ran into Nazism rising into power, so the ending of the movie was alternated to subtly pander to pro-Nazi ideals, but even this stopped it from screening in 1934 because it was “decadent”, and the Nazi regime reportedly tried to burn every last copy of the film. Other films tried to follow the equality message spread by this movie, however the Nazis were quick to ban them, as it went against the nazi ideologies.
<br /><br />
The film was almost banned in the US, displaying the gender equality difference between golden years Germany and the US, but with Eleanor Roosevelt speaking highly of the film, it gained a limited release, but after the war it was heavily censored until 1970.

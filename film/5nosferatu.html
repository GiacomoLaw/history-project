  <h2>Nosferatu</h2>
    <p>Nosferatu was a German horror film that was silent. It was filmed in 1921, and released in Germany in 1922. It was later released in America in 1929. The movie was about a vampire who lived in a castle that was at the top of hill. It was given positive reviews, and had a high average rating, saying that the film was indeed scary. 
<br /><br />
However, the makers of the film, Prana Filmâ€™s, went bankrupt due to the film violating copyrights. This meant that Nosferatu was their only film. It was ordered that all the movies had to be destroyed, however by the time that occurred it was too late as the movie had been distributed across the world.

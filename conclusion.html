  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <div class="center"><img src="imgs/conclusion.jpg" style="height:300px"/></div><br />  
  <p>To conclude, the Weimar republicâ€™s golden years really had a huge impact on film, with key films such as Metropolis building a bridge for later sci fi films to cross and improve, or The adventures of Prince Achmed which took 3 years to make and it was animated as well as having a female director, providing equality which was a big breakthrough for the time, and films like Girls in Uniform supported this idea, as well as delving into homosexuality. Films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari were innovative in ways such as the peculiar setting and how it had a twist ending, a very uncommon sight in films.
    <br /><br />
Equality as thriving. Films also supported foreign friendship, as the films were silent which removed the language barrier and allowed foreign actors to act, some even getting the lead role which would also make the film popular in the country of that actor, gaining more audience members. 
<br /><br />
And that was the most important part for directors to chase, as a bigger audience meant a better profit for the film and this profit was needed in order to deal with the modest production budgets due to the unstable economic condition, especially with the early films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. 
<br /><br />
The most common genre of film for the Weimar republic was German expressionism, used because of the silent nature of the films and inspired by expressionist movement in art with heavy reliance on symbolism and artistic imagery instead of stark realism to tell a story, the story of which being based around crime and horror due to the grim mood of post-WWI.
<br /><br />
Overall, the Weimar golden years were perfect for film, developing into innovative pieces that allowed the German people to escape daily life.</p>
